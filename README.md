SMS spam detection focuses on identifying and filtering out unwanted or harmful messages, such as advertisements, phishing attempts, or scams. It analyzes characteristics of the message, such as suspicious keywords, unusual patterns, or sender behavior, to determine if it's spam. This process ensures users receive only relevant and safe messages, enhancing privacy and reducing distractions caused by unnecessary texts.
